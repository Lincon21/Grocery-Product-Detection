# Grocery-Product-Detection
This repository builds a product detection model to recognize products from grocery shelf images. The dataset comes from [here](https://github.com/gulvarol/grocerydataset). Everything from data preparation to model training is done using [Colab Notebooks](https://colab.research.google.com/) so that no setup is required locally.
